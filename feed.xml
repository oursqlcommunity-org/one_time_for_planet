        <title>DuckDB internals(1)-File Format Overview</title>
        <link href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/duckdb-internals1-file-format-overview-zongzhi-chen-xudxc/"/>

This article, as the first in the DuckDB source code analysis series, will begin by introducing the file format, focusing on the storage of metadata, while subsequent articles will examine table data storage. All analysis in this article is based on DuckDB version 1.3.1 source code, and the TL;DR is found at the end of the article.</content>
